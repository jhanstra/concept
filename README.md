# [Concept](http://c-o-n-c-e-p-t.com/)

Concept is a modern, flexible CSS framework for creating beautiful web pages. It values modularity, flexibility, modern design, and efficiency.

**Concept is currently in alpha and not ready for production use.**

## Get Started

You can install Concept in a few different ways:
- Bower: `bower install concept`
- Download the source (Sass files):
- Download the distribution CSS:

## File Structure

Concept uses Sass as its preprocessor. This allows you to completely customize the look of your web page with just a few variables. It also allows you to easily remove components and styles you don't need, for a smaller footprint.

Concept's styles are broken down into four categories: base, components, mixins, and variables.

#### Base
The Base folder contains much of the CSS for basic HTML elements, along with basic classes for styling those elements. It contains styles for buttons, content, icons, images, input, links, lists, tables, typography, and the grid.

#### Components
The Components folder contains higher-level classes for targeting sets of HTML elements. For example, it has styles for headers, top navigation, sidebar navigation, cards, etc.

#### Mixins
The Mixins folder contains all the Sass mixins used throughout Concept.

#### Variables
The Variables folder contains all of the Sass variables used throughout Concept. They are separated into the colors.scss and variables.scss files.
