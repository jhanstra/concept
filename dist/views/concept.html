      <h2>Why use Concept?</h2>
      <p>Concept brings together some of the best features of other CSS frameworks and introduces a few tricks of its own. It's not too big, not too small. Customizable, but not too customizable. Incredibly powerful, yet easy to use.</p>

      <h4>Next-gen</h4>
      <p>Concept uses cutting-edge CSS3 features and follows modern design trends and techniques. It is designed for power users and doesn't support older browsers (&ltIE 9).</p>

    <div class="c-left-aligned-content c-dark">
      <h4>Beautiful</h4>
      <p>Every pixel in Concept's classes has been obsessed over. No matter what kind of web thing you want to make, Concept will make it look beautiful. Check out what has been built.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="c-left-aligned-content">
      <h4>Modular</h4>
      <p>Concept allows you to build custom styles by combining CSS classes. Every class does only what it needs to, and no more. Want a small, rounded success button with lowercase letters that presses down on hover?</p>
      <a href="" class="c-btn c-sm c-rounded c-success c-clicky c-lowercase">No problem</a>
    </div>
    <div class="c-left-aligned-content c-dark">
      <h4>Flexible</h4>
      <p>Customization with Sass variables is not only possible, it's encouraged. Concept makes it easy to completely change the appearance of your website with just a handful of variables.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="c-left-aligned-content">
      <h4>Prefixed</h4>
      <p>Always know where your styles are coming from. Concept's classes are prefixed with c- so you always know which styles are coming from the Concept framework and which are coming from elsewhere.</p>
